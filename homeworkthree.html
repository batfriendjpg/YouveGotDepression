	<font color="white" size="4px"> Time to get homework done. You need to get your homework done. Homework is something we should do, besides it's not like it will be that hard. What do we need to do again? That's right, there's a whole list of things that need to be taken care of. We have some stuff due tomorrow but there are some other projects that would be more fun to work on too. I mean, do you really want to do your homework? We should. We need to. Doing homework sucks, though. Maybe we can get moving by doing something else. Honestly, we could do anything else. You can never concentrate anyway, so it's not like you will actually get anything done. We can do it later, there is still plenty of time in the day. You should stop worrying about your grades so much, it's annoying. Besides, thinking about it is just going to make your anxiety worse, so just stop. It doesn't matter. Don't do your homework, but at least do something. You could play on your phone. Of course you would play on your phone, you're so lazy. Maybe you should actually do something for once. Take a shower, make your bed, clean, talk to a friend, play on your phone, watch something on your list, play one of the games you like, or read a book. That or just do the easy thing and play on your phone like you always do. Of course, we wouldn't do something productive. You're such a lazy idiot. Do you actually want to do your homework? Your grade in that class is high enough to miss this assignment, and the next, and maybe the next. At this point, why even go to class? Do you really want to go to class? No because you're lazy. You're lazy and mediocre enough to settle for your grades slipping, so you can do what? That's right play around on your phone and throw away all of your potential. So, yeah. Why go to class when you could just take a nap? Maybe watch something on Netflix. Go ahead and do anything else but your homework. Seriously, is this something you actually want to do? Sure, there are so many easier things that you could be doing instead. Don't forget that you are the one who wanted this though! The one who wants to do these classes and try these things while you stumble towards what exactly? What happened to you? You are so tired, and heavy. Why do you keep pushing yourself? Why can't you just take a break. A real actual break, then maybe we would have the energy to put some effort into something. Take a minute to stop and watch a show or movie, or you could sit there and play on your phone. Then you will just keep playing on your phone till all the time you had is gone. As long as you are not trying to do your homework, right? It isn't do till tomorrow anyway. You still have a few hours in the day. Just do it later, do what you want to do now. Do it before class even, it will be good enough. As long as you just get a passing grade, right? That is what you are comfortable with now. This is who you are now. I mean you can't even put in the effort to take care of yourself, you are so tired and heavy, just lay down, take a nap. Maybe try waking yourself up more with a shower. Get some rest, or play on your phone. There is something else you could do, something that would take less time and effort. Less energy. Maybe that is something you can handle. Then, you can do your homework later. Are you really all that interested in doing it now? Especially, when you can just do it later. Just do your homework later, why bother. They probably won't even check this assignment. The fact that we are even thinking about that, who are you? What happened to you? I mean, what is wrong with you? Just stop. Just make it stop. Stop thinking about it. God why can't you just do your homework? What is wrong with you? Why can't you stop being so lazy? Why can't you just move? This shouldn't be so hard. This isn't normal, you're not normal, what is wrong with you? You can't get anything done, what happened to all the movtivation you used to have? Maybe you were just better when everything was bad. You can't seem to do anything now, I mean what happened to you? Things are good and now you can't function? Are you just addicted to the chaos? Is that why you just sit here and do nothing, you just stare at the wall screaming at yourself? Because you can't function unless everyone hates you, unless your being ignored? You had so much potential and now look at you. Now what? You're going to sit here and scream for all of college? You can't even ask for help! You just sit here! Doing nothing at all. Why can't you do anything? Please just do something! It should be so easy. It's your body just move it. Just make it move, why won't we just move? You can't even do ti for the things you like, what is wrong with you? You can't even be lazy, it's worse. It's like your some broken machine and now you can't do anything unless you are told to. Unless you have to and then you rush to produce some half attempt at what you could have done well. You are drowning in all the things that could be done, and should be done better if you could just get yourself to move for once! Please! Just move! Why can't you move? Why are we like this? Why can't you just be better? Why don't we matter enough to do anything? Please, just get up. Just shower, or do your homework, or take a nap even just something other than sitting here and wasting time. You are just wasting time! We only have so much time. It's going to slip by so fast. it is slipping by so fast. How long have you just been sitting here? How much time has been wasted? Before you now it the sun is going to go down, the day will be done. Another day gone, another day wasted. More of your life and potential that is just slipping away. You are just letting it slip away! Get up. Now! Get up right now and do something! You need to do your homework. You should be doing your homework. You have to do your homework! You have to. It's not optional, this is something you have to do. You used to be such a good student and now look at you, you get an ounce of freedom and you suddenly can't do anything. What is this? What is wrong with you? Why is nothing ever enough for you to be able to do anything? Why is nothing ever enough? Why can't you just do something? You used to be able to do so much. You used to be able to accomplish so much, you moved mountains and you have what you want now and what? We are just going to sit here? We finally have everything we could have wanted and we are going to squander all of that looking at a wall all day and doing nothing!  </font>
